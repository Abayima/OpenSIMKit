INTRODUCTION
------------

Open SIM Kit (OSK) is a technology platform for sharing digital information using feature phones while removing mobile service providers as the ‘middle-man’. The goal is to offer a discreet and resilient means for communication during scenarios where mobile networks have either been compromised or otherwise disrupted.

This document outlines the goals of the project, the potential use cases, and timeline for the release of the open source project.

PROJECT OVERVIEW AND ORIGINS
----------------------------

The primary challenge being addressed is how we might allow citizens to share news and information when communication networks are compromised.  This is particularly relevant to those residing in developing countries.  

There is a secondary challenge that is addressed - turning the SIM-mobile phone combination into a viable publishing platform for content distribution without relying upon mobile networks and SMS. This will allow for the distribution of digital content to feature phone users in a way that does not rely upon a connection to mobile networks. Use cases might include distributing public health information, digital text books, or sports and entertainment news.
