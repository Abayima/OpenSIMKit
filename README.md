Introduction
------------

Open SIM Kit (OSK) is a technology platform for sharing digital information using feature phones while removing mobile service providers as the ‘middle-man’. The goal is to offer a discreet and resilient means for communication during scenarios where mobile networks have either been compromised or otherwise disrupted.

Open SIM Kit was developed to enable the greater Abayima project, which aims to serve the world’s poorest users who’s voices are often silenced when the cheap/accessible forms of mobile communication are severed.  These populations cannot afford high-tech solutions and rarely possess the skills to make use of them even if they could.

This document outlines the goals of the project, the potential use cases, and timeline for the release of the open source project.

Project Overview and Origins
----------------------------

The primary challenge being addressed is how we might allow citizens to share news and information when communication networks are compromised.  This is particularly relevant to those residing in developing countries.  

For instance, in Uganda during the 2010 elections, where we first piloted this project, mobile networks were being monitored to identify any voice of dissent and activists faced repercussions or arrest. With the Abayima pilot, we were able to introduce a method for sharing information by turning SIM cards into storage devices and, by extension, mobile phones into e-readers.

This is not that different from simply using pen and paper to write discreet messages, however in this context the paper and pen are the mobile phone and sim card respectively.  There are added layers of security (encryption) that we are working on. 

There is a secondary challenge which we describe in more details below - turning the sim-mobile platform into a viable publishing platform for content distribution without relying upon mobile networks.

Our aim is to ultimately make it possible to circumvent authoritarian and malicious governments who often target telecom infrastructure and service providers to silence their opposition.  We've seen a need for solutions like Open SIM Kit in locations all over the world, from Syria and Egypt to Uganda and Libya.
