ZTE USB MODEM Driver
====================

This modem driver was developed for use with Open SIM Kit (OSK).


INSTRUCTIONS
------------

Open SIM Kit (OSK) is a technology platform for sharing digital information using feature phones while removing mobile service providers as the ‘middle-man’. The goal is to offer a discreet and resilient means for communication during scenarios where mobile networks have either been compromised or otherwise disrupted.

This document outlines the goals of the project, the potential use cases, and timeline for the release of the open source project.
